## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Local Development

Follow these steps to get your LiveShare application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js (LTS version recommended)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn** (optional)
-   **Git** (optional, but recommended for version control)

### 1. Clone the Repository (or extract the downloaded code)

If you downloaded the code as a ZIP, extract it to your desired directory. If you're using Git:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/live-share-app.git
cd live-share-app
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and install the required packages. We use `--legacy-peer-deps` to handle potential peer dependency conflicts.

\`\`\`bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# Or if you prefer Yarn:
# yarn install
\`\`\`

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
\`\`\`

### 4. Configure Next.js

Ensure your `next.config.mjs` file is correctly configured for Socket.io:

\`\`\`javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  serverExternalPackages: ['socket.io']
};

export default nextConfig;
\`\`\`

### 5. Add Middleware for Socket.io

Create a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your project:

\`\`\`typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/socket')) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/api/socket/:path*',
}
\`\`\`

### 6. Configure PostCSS (for Tailwind CSS)

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project:

\`\`\`javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
\`\`\`

### 7. Update Global CSS (for animations)

Ensure your `app/globals.css` includes the `fadeIn` keyframe:

\`\`\`css
/* ... existing Tailwind imports and base layers ... */

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

/* Add this to your root element or a specific component if you want to apply it */
.animate-fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.8s ease-out forwards;
}
\`\`\`

### 8. Add Favicons

Place your favicon files directly in the `app` directory. Next.js will automatically pick them up. For example:

-   `app/favicon.ico`
-   `app/icon.png`
-   `app/apple-icon.png`

You can use placeholder images or generate your own.

### 9. Run the Development Server

Once all dependencies are installed and configurations are set, start the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# Or with Yarn:
# yarn dev
\`\`\`

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  **Access the App**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Create a Room**: Enter your name and click "Create New Room". A unique room code will be generated.
3.  **Join a Room**: Share the room code with others. They can enter their name and the code on the homepage to join.
4.  **Live Video/Audio**: Click the "Video" and "Audio" buttons to toggle your camera and microphone. Grant permissions when prompted.
5.  **Live Location**: Click the "Location" button to share your real-time GPS location.
6.  **Share Files**: Click "Share File" to upload and share documents, images, or other files with room participants.

## üåê Deployment

You can deploy this application to various platforms. Here are instructions for Render and Vercel, two popular choices for Next.js applications.

### Deploying to Render.com

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: If you haven't already, create a new public GitHub repository and push your project code to it.
2.  **Go to Render**: Visit [render.com](https://render.com) and log in or sign up.
3.  **Create New Web Service**: Click "New +" -> "Web Service".
4.  **Connect GitHub**: Connect your GitHub account and select your `live-share-app` repository.
5.  **Configure Settings**:
    -   **Name**: `live-share-app` (or your preferred name)
    -   **Region**: Choose a region closest to your users.
    -   **Branch**: `main` (or your primary branch)
    -   **Root Directory**: Leave empty.
    -   **Runtime**: `Node`
    -   **Build Command**: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
    -   **Start Command**: `npm start`
    -   **Node Version**: `18.17.0` (or a recent LTS version)
    -   **Auto-Deploy**: `Yes`
6.  **Environment Variables**: Add `NODE_ENV` with value `production`.
7.  **Create Web Service**: Click "Create Web Service" and wait for the deployment to complete. Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`.

### Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is highly optimized for Next.js applications and often provides the simplest deployment experience.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push your project code to a new public GitHub repository.
2.  **Go to Vercel**: Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in or sign up (GitHub login is recommended).
3.  **Import Project**: Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
4.  **Import Git Repository**: Select your `live-share-app` repository from GitHub.
5.  **Configure Project**: Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project.
    -   **Root Directory**: Leave as default (`./`).
    -   **Build and Output Settings**: Vercel usually auto-configures these correctly for Next.js.
6.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy". Vercel will build and deploy your application.
7.  **Live URL**: Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a live URL (e.g., `https://live-share-app-xyz.vercel.app`).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

-   **Dependency Conflicts (`ERESOLVE`)**: If `npm install` fails, try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` or `npm install --force`. Clearing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before reinstalling can also help.
-   **`next` command not found**: Ensure you are running `npm run dev` or `npx next dev` from your project's root directory.
-   **WebRTC (Video/Audio) Issues**:
    -   WebRTC requires a secure context (HTTPS) for production environments. Both Render and Vercel provide HTTPS automatically.
    -   Ensure you grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted by your browser.
    -   Test on `localhost` first, as it's considered a secure context for development.
-   **Socket.io Connection Issues**: Check your browser's developer console for network errors. Ensure your server is running and accessible.
